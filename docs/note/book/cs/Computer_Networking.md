# *Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach*

# Chapter 1 Computer Networks and the Internet

## 1.1 What  Is the Internet?

1. First, we can describe the nuts and bolts of the Internet, that is the basic hardware and software components that make up the Internet
2. Second, we can describe the Internet in terms of a networking infrastructure that provides services to distributed applications

### 1.1.1 A Nuts-and-Bolts Description

some jargon

1. host
2. end system
3. communication link
4. packet switches
5. transmission rate
6. router
7. link-layer switches
8. route/path
9. ISP: Internet Service Provider
10. TCP/IP
11. Internet standards
12. RFC: requests for comment

### 1.1.2 A Service Description

1. Describe the Internet from an entirely different angle: Namely, as *an infrastructure that provides services to applications*
   1. How does one program running on one end system instruct the Internet to deliver data to another program running on another end system 用写信的例子类比socket interface

### 1.1.3 What Is a Protocol

1. The exchange of messages and the actions taken when these  messages are sent and received are the key defining elements of a protocol
2. A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event

## 1.2 The Network Edge

1. End system: they sit at the edge of the Internet  *host = end system*

### 1.2.1 Access Networks

1. Access network —the network that physically connects an end system to the first router(edge router)
2. DSL: digital subscriber line
3. Cable Internet access
4. Fiber to the home
